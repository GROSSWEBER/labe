# Architecture

[Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) for orchestration (but trying to keep
task code minimal). Structured directories and filenames for data artifacts.

![](static/labe-tree.png)

The result are three [sqlite3](https://sqlite.org/) databases:

* a) id-doi "mapping" database
* b) "citations" databases (doi-doi)
* c) index "metadata" key value store (id-doc)

There is one "mapping" and one "citations" database, but there can be one or
more "metadata" databases.

A server assembles fused results from these databases on the fly (and caches
expesive requests).

This way we should get a good balance:

* we need *little preprocessing*, we mostly turn CSV or SOLR JSON into sqlite databases
* we still can *be fast* through caching, which can be done forehandedly ("cache
  warming") or as data is actually requests

The server delivers JSON responses, which can be included in catalog frontends.
